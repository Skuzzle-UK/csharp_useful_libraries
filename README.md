# useful_libraries
 Some useful libraries I have created for various programming languages.

 Please feel free to make suggestions of changes to existing or new libraries and help this to become a really useful resource.

 ## Folder Structure
 Libraries are to be placed in a folder which gives context to the library.

 For example, *decimals_extended.cs* is placed in the *C#/numbers* folder as it is a C# library for extending decimal numbers.

 *binary.cs* also makes it to the *C#/numbers* folder due to being a C# library for working with binary numbers.
